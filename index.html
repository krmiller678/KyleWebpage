									<h3>Personal Introduction</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\MostarScaled.jpg" alt="" /></span>First and foremost, I am a big brother to two awesome little sisters and a partner to my wonderful fiancée. Growing up, I always loved being a big brother and take great pride in being there to support those I care about. I am incredibly fortunate to have these women in my life and lucked out in that they all love (tolerate) the same things as me! We share common interests in music, math, science, history, and travel. Over this past year, my fiancée and I were able to travel to Bosnia, Croatia, and Montenegro as a part of a former Yugo tour to meet many of her family members who still live there. For ten days I was completely immersed in their culture and had to learn how to communicate with 95% of all interactions being in a foreign language. The banner picture on this site is actually a photo I took!</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\SiblingsScaled.jpg" alt="" /></span>A huge part of my identity is derived from being a <i>novus homo</i>, or a new man. Everything I have accomplished in my adult life has been a direct result of efforts and actions I have taken. I started off with very little and am absolutely obsessed with continual progress. Throughout my life I have described myself with three titles: <b>Learner</b>, <b>Teacher</b>, and <b>Problem Solver</b>. All of us are bound by time as a common constraint, and the only direction that you can travel is forward. I am always trying to improve by some measure and always willing to change my ways if presented with new evidence, however I will ardently defend that which I believe is right. I am attentive to my mental and physical health, as well as particularly considerate of the company I keep. A couple of my favorite quotes are listed below! </p>
										<blockquote>"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." - Isaac Newton </blockquote>
										<blockquote>“There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.” - Ernest Hemingway</blockquote>

												<h4><a href="https://github.com/krmiller678/Sudoku-Project-Group-25">Sudoku</a></h4>
												<p>This project marked my first time working on a large programming project with a group. My programming has improved greatly since this, however it is a fond memory and a good milestone. The repository is a little messy, for a quick look check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDEfjxFOGkI&t=197s&ab_channel=KyleMiller">YouTube link</a>.</p>

												<h4><a href="https://www.crunchperks.com/">Crunch's Corporate Partner Division</a></h4>
