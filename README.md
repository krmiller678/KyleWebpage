## About The Project
My personal website, KyleMiller.online, went live in October of 2024. This website will continue to evolve overtime, but serves to catalog some of the benchmarks I have achieved over my programming career. The original site has already changed 
quite a bit since its inception, however the OG template came from an open license to an [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) source project.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Separate out sections of website into separate html files (with proper nav)
- [ ] Add in home page _FeaturedProjects_ Section
- [ ] Add in a contact form
- [ ] Add in some games!

Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
